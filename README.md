Instructions:
 
 Write a program that will take three inputs: the amount the consumer needs to receive, the interest rate,
 and the duration of the loan in months. The program should then calculate the face value required in
 order for the consumer to receive the amount needed. It should also calculate the monthly payment.
 
 Your program should generate output similar to the following:
 Please enter the annual interest rate as a percentage (e.g., 15 for 15%) (enter 0 to
 quit): 15
 Please enter the amount you would like to receive: 1000
 Please enter loan period in months: 12
 The total amount of your loan (including interest at 15% per annum) is $1176.47.
 Your monthly payment for 12 months will be $98.04.
 Please enter the annual interest rate as a percentage (e.g., 15 for 15%) (enter 0 to
 quit): 0
 Exit code: 0 (normal program termination
 
 Group members:
 
 All members of the team contributed to the code, pseudo code, comments and this documentation.
 
 Yan Ngo - Manager, contributor
        - Yan was responsible of assigning roles, keeping track of the progress, time management, organizing tasks.
        
 Patricia Antlitz - Recorder, driver
        - Patricia was the driver for part of the lab and picked as the recorder.
        Report:
        Our group took a few minutes to discuss our understanding about the assignment and what would be our individual approach to it. We all knew we needed a while loop, but each member had different ideas on how to implement it. Some of us wanted to initialize a boolean variable to use as condition, we decided towards having a variable "i" to enter the loop. We figured a boolean was unnecessary, since the user has to enter the number 0 to quit the program anyway. Some of the members were not familiar with the cout->fixed and position assignments, so that is something that some learned today. Our loan algorithm was a collaboration. 
 
 Guarav Bhatnagar - Presenter, driver
        - Guarav was the driver for part of the lab, and was picked as the presenter. We didn't have a question for the instructor, but Guarav made sure our group was all set by encouraging us to talk through our questions to one another.
        
 Khoa Bui - Reflector, contributor
        - Khoa was in charge of making sure the team reached MVP, agreed with the solutions and the final code.
        Report:
        Our team was successful in organizing our priorities and tasks in order to finish this assignment. We had discussions about the assignment's requirements before we started coding, in order to make sure we were all on the same page. Everyone participated equally.
